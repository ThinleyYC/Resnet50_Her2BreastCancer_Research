 Tools used: Kaggle 
 
 Language: Python

Experimental code as part of Research Paper on Her2 breast cancer prediction using Transfer Learning Model, ResNet50 (Yet to be published for Conference).

The experiments done can show that unfreezing of layers 3 and 4, and training the deep learning model over 100 epochs had a great performance on the test dataset as compared to keeping all layer frozen. 

With a 96% accuracy and high AUC ROC score, our trained model performed really well in predicitng HER2 Breast Cancer exression levels, with the addition of Explainable AI, GradCam for relaibility.
